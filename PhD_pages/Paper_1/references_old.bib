               income shares are now similar to (or higher than) the levels

               increased substantially more in Russia than in China and other
               ex-communist countries in Eastern Europe. We relate this finding
               to the specific transition strategy followed in Russia.
               According to our benchmark estimates, the wealth held offshore

               disputed for 30 years. Although there are better data than ever
               before, controversies are not resolved. A major problem is that
               consumption measured from household surveys, which is used to
               measure poverty, grows less rapidly than consumption measured in
               national accounts, in the world as a whole and in large
               countries, particularly India, China, and the United States. In
               consequence, measured poverty has fallen less rapidly than
               appears warranted by measured growth in poor countries. One
               plausible cause is that richer households are less likely to
               participate in surveys. But growth in the national accounts is
               also upward biased, and consumption in the national accounts
               contains large and rapidly growing items that are not consumed
               by the poor and not included in surveys. So it is possible for
               consumption of the poor to grow less rapidly than national
               consumption, without any increase in measured inequality.
               Current statistical procedures in poor countries understate the
               rate of global poverty reduction, and overstate growth in the

               We find that between 1820 and 1950, increasing per capita income
               is combined with increasing global inequality. After 1950,
               global inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient or the

               the global income distribution was uni-modal in the nineteenth

              Our analyses, based on a standardized definition of fiscal
              income, allow us to locate, for top-income groups, the sources of
              discrepancy. We find, using the cases of the United States,

              data correspond extremely well (in terms of total income, mean

              about income composition, available in the US, allows us to
              investigate the determinants of this gap in the US. About
              three-fourths of the tax/survey gap is due to differences in
              non-labor incomes, especially self-employment (business) income.
              The gap itself may be due to tax-induced re-classification of

              New data reveal less income inequality in the developing world
              than 30 years ago. However, this is due to falling inequality
              between countries. Average inequality within developing countries
              has been slowly rising, though staying fairly flat since 2000. As
              a rule, higher rates of growth in average incomes have not put
              upward pressure on inequality within countries. Growth has
              generally helped reduce the incidence of absolute poverty, but
              less so in more unequal countries. High inequality also threatens
              to stall future progress against poverty by attenuating growth
              prospects. Perceptions of rising absolute gaps in living

               during 1975--2010 using data from the most recent version of the
               World Income Inequality Database (WIID). The picture that
               emerges using `absolute,' and even `centrist' measures of
               inequality, is very different from the results obtained using
               standard `relative' inequality measures such as the Gini
               coefficient or Coefficient of Variation. Relative global
               inequality has declined substantially over the decades. In
               contrast, `absolute' inequality, as captured by the Standard
               Deviation and Absolute Gini, has increased considerably and
               unabated. Like these `absolute' measures, our `centrist'
               inequality indicators, the Krtscha measure and an intermediate
               Gini, also register a pronounced increase in global inequality,
               albeit, in the case of the latter, with a decline during 2005 to
               2010. A critical question posed by our findings is whether
               increased levels of inequality according to absolute and
               centrist measures are inevitable at today's per capita income
               levels. Our analysis suggests that it is not possible for
               absolute inequality to return to 1975 levels without further
               convergence in mean incomes among countries. Inequality, as
               captured by centrist measures such as the Krtscha, could return
               to 1975 levels, at today's domestic and global per capita income
               levels, but this would require quite dramatic structural reforms
               to reduce domestic inequality levels in most countries.",
