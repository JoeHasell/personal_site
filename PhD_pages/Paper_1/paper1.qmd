What has happened to inequality within countries over the past generation?

Many answers for individual countries, or for particular regions. Can Our understanding of inequality trends *globally*, however, remains fragmented unclear.

For many it is a given . Many papers in the social sciences, or policy notes begin 'decades of rising inequality' – without to specify where. Implying ubiquitous.

Does not reflect the conflicting data.

This stands in contrast with the data in PIP – an important data source. Relied on for SDGs.



Confusiong terrain: e.g. where for SDGs they use PIP; but HDR they use WID.


Our view remains highly fragmented. Different global datasets offer starkly differing or even contradictory views 

Despite the wealth of data available, our view of inequality around the world remains fragmented and unclear.

These are questions that we need answers to. Winners and loosers of globalization. Policy to tackle inequality. SDGs. Philanthropy.

That's what this paper is going to do. (Outline structure).


## Why do we need a global view on inequality?

## What do I mean by global view on inequality?

- Concept 1 and 2, but not 3. Companion paper.
- Relative not absolute.


## Global data on inequality

### Global databases

A global view faces the hard limitation of the underlying data. This has two sides: firstly is there any data? Secondly the comparability of the data, across countries and over time.

Much improved – *harmonized* secondary databases. Three of note.

- PIP

- WID

- LIS



### Two worlds of inequality measurement



#### Connecting up the worlds is valuable

- for Policy
- for academic research


## Triangulating a global view


### Since 1990



### Since 1980




### Comparing metrics

Does it make a difference whether we look at Gini or top 10%?

People worry about whether Gini masks what's happening at the top.

Empirically: 
    - Make a linear model of top 10% on Gini, for each source separately
    - Make predicted top 10%
    - Take a look at the R2
    - Investigate individual countries with very poor predictions

Sub-Saharan Africa: example where the Gini fell in more cases than the top 10%.

### Since 1990


Similarities:

Convergence – Smaller rises in coutries that started out with high inequality. Driven regionally. (We could do a test for this.)

Indeed for some regions very similar picture:

    - MENA - Roughly 2 point fall, both Gini and top 10%. Only one country with a rise: Not total agreeement on coverage (one country either side)

    - South and South East Asia – Very similar not weighting by population. But wildly different when weighting by population, due to the much much stronger rise

    -  Sub-Saharan Afric – Very similar across sources. Top 10: Roughly even mix of rises and falling countries, but with a 3 point fall on average. Gini: More falls, 5 point on average. (Mention data quality issues: e.g. Kenya big fall. Lesoto big fall. But how comparable are the surveys?? Same surveys underlie WID...)

    - Western Europe – Rises in a majority of countries, but relatively moderate of 1-2 points (Whether Gini of top 10).


Differences:

Verry different bottom line at the global level:

- PIP: roughly equal numbers falling and rising. 0 average change – though a modest rise when pop weighted (2 points). Same whether Gini or Top 10. That's without LAtin America (Which WID is missing). Includung LatAm tips nudges it (with about a 1 point fall unweighter and 1 point rise weighted)

- WID: Far more countries with rising inequality. On average a 3 point rise (whether top 10 or Gini) – [Better to express these relative to the level of ineq. i.e. % increase rather than % point increase? A point rise means 'less' in WID terms because inequality levels are much higher.] But the most stark difference comes when we weight by population. Some key populous countries: India, China, US?, Indonesia? Russia 

That difference is driven by particular regions:
- 


More countries with rises. LArger rises. Especially larger populations. Average view very different:





Countries where the sources paint a radically different picture that affect the aggregate results:

- India: Insane rise in WID 34->56
- China:
- Russia: Massive drop in PIP. Insane rise in WID.
- USA: Much larger rise in WID.

What explains the different trends in these countries? (We can maybe look in more detail, at different welfare concepts etc.)

It sometimes goes the other way: Indonesia – Rise in PIP, fall in WID.

#### Method 2: Use a regression to obtain the time trend

## Explaining differences between PIP and WID data

### For a subset of countries we can bridge between the PIP and WID data

Besides the underlying data sources, there are many differences between what is being measured in the PIP and WID data - notably the welfare concept and unit of analysis/equivalization.

In order to get a better understanding of where differences between the datasets arise, for a subset of countries we can bridge between the two somewhat. For example:

-   WID has post-tax income series for some countries
-   We can use LIS to look at how changing the welfare concept, unit of analysis, equivalisation affects things. (For equivalisation, we could also possibly use the newly available PIP harmonized microdata).

### More in-depth discussion of particular outliers

-   Russia is a very notable case where the two datasets tell very different stories.
